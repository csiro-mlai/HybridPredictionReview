# Present


# Since last time

* MARS2021 üòÖ
* [groundwater modeling review doc commenced](https://www.overleaf.com/3226512942vxpbqtsrggtn)
* further development in Fourier Neural Operator

  * induces new uncertainty quantification problem 
  * State is ‚Äútoo long‚Äù

* Alasdair Tran (Working with Alex Matthews and Lexing Xie at ANU) is working on exactly this model (2d fluid flow in time) and encountering sdimilar problems. May be worth code sharing.

# Next steps

* Allow FNO to learn hidden state
