# Since last time

### ICASSP happened

Main result of interest:
_model driven filtering_ [@RevachKalmannet2021;ShlezingerModelBased2020].

### Software engineeering

[Much software engineering](https://github.com/alasdairtran/fourierflow/blob/main/fourierflow/datastores/synthetic/ns_2d.py) has been happening

This is needed so that 

1. code is cleaner (nice)
2. code can be parallelized on our HPC (needed eventually)
3. input data can be generalized (needed right now)

This work is conducted in collaboration with Alasdair Tran at ANU CECs.

Currently we are investigating some alternative solvers to see which is least annoying.

### Project upscaling discussions

If we had other workers on the project and we broadened the scope, could we put them to work?

IMO, yes.
We could easily spend more hours on the most time-consuming parts of the project
In (Dan's) estimated priority order these would be

1. HPC implementation
2. PDE analysis
3. Neural uncertainty quantification

Alternatively, can we access labour from other sources?

Several people have expressed degrees of interest in the project.
(Mahmood Aktar at IM&T, Xuhui Fan at MLAIFSP Context(?), Alasdair Tran at ANU CECS).
