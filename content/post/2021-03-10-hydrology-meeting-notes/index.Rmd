# Present

* Dan MacKinlay
* â€¦

# Since last time

Dan has been reviewing alternative techniques from the literature for non-stationary PDEs

* _Weak_ formulation @BaoNumerical2020; @ZangWeak2020
* Basis decomposition @SigristStochastic2015; @LiuStatistical2020; @LiFourier2020, which is apparently especially useful for advection-diffusion equations

#  Discussions

* can we get gradient out of MODFLOW sims?
* how close to advection-diffusion are we in groundwater?

# Next steps
