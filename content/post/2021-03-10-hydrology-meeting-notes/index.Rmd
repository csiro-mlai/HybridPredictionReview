# Present

* Dan MacKinlay
* â€¦

# Since last time

Dan has been reviewing alternative techniques from the literature for non-stationary PDEs

* _Weak_ formulation @BaoNumerical2020; @ZangWeak2020
* Basis decomposition @SigristStochastic2015; @LiuStatistical2020; @LiFourier2020, which is apparently especially useful for advection-diffusion equations

#  Discussions

* Dan Questions

  * can we get gradient out of MODFLOW sims?
  * how close to advection-diffusion are we in groundwater?
  * New training data set: can we get data set of groundwater sims with forcings and latent parameters for supervised learning?
  * Meta learning: can we learn a good set of models
  * Is there a reason that plain old MCMC won't work here?
# Next steps
