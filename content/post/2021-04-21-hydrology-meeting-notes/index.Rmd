# Since last time

## Simulation progress

Tao and Dan have been working on generic simulations via MODFLOW to match the neural emulator.
Plan to get modflow output that includes

1. time-step data, not simply the data from the end of each stress period
2. parse HDS-output to access this from python. Tao has provided scripts for this

Notes on @LiFourier2020:

1. We are essentially rediscovering section 5.4 in their methods at this stage (Bayesian inverse), although we we can also get the forcings implemented this will be an extension
2. their Fourier transform implementation is terrible; we can do better
3. Their comparison against traditional PDE solvers for MCMC is not fair — they differentiate through all iterations of the solver rather than using the fact that the system is at equilibrium, which penalises a traditional PDE solver.
4. The results in the paper are not reproducible in the case of interest to us — data-set handling differs between their training data and fitting procedure

## Review paper

Process TBD.
Examples: @FarkasWastewater2020; @ZemaPostfire2021

Using some material from https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/ml_pde.html

#  Discussions

* Publishing as shiny app e.g. via https://shiny.csiro.au/
* or as a distill app https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/visualizing-weights/
* Petra's example: https://github.com/pkuhnert/MMPde
* upcoming postdocs pitches 

# Next steps

* debug the data set handling issue
* connect Tao's MODFLOW simulation code
* posterior simulation using emulated likelihood
* contact authors of paper to clarify
* begin review paper, posibly starting from material in https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/ml_pde.html
