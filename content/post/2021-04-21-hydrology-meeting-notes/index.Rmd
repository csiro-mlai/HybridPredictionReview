# Present

# Since last time

Tao and Dan have been working on generic simulations via MODFLOW to match the neural emulator.
Plan to get modflow output that includes

1. time-step data, not simply the data from the end of each stress period
2. parse HDS-output to access this from python

Notes on @LiFourier2020:

1. We are essentially rediscovering section 5.4 in their methods at this stage (Bayesian inverse), although we we can also get the forcings implemented this will be an extension
2. their Fourier transform implementation is terrible; we can do better
